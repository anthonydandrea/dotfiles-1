> My dot files

It's not recommended that you install these dots on your machine since it's highly personalized for my workspace,
but I do recommend checking out these files and directories that contain useful snippets and programs:

- [`~/.functions`](functions)
- [`~/.aliases`](aliases)
- [`~/.tmux.conf`](tmux.conf)
- [`~/.bin`](bin)

My vim dot files are on a seperate repo: [dotvim](https://github.com/miguelmota/dotvim)
